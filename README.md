# Simple Pseudocode Solutions

## Overview
This project contains three basic math-related programs that solve common problems using simple logic. The problems are:
1. Finding the maximum of three numbers.
2. Summing a series of random integers between 1 and 1000 (exclusive).
3. Multiplying two integers without using the multiplication operator (`*`).

## Solutions
Each problem has been solved using a clear, step-by-step approach. Below is a brief description of each solution.

### 1. Find Maximum of Three Numbers
This program takes three integers as input and determines the largest number among them. It uses conditional checks (`if-else`) to compare the numbers and outputs the maximum.

**Input**: Three integers  
**Output**: The largest of the three numbers

### 2. Sum Random Integers Between 1 and 1000 (Exclusive)
This program generates a series of random integers between 2 and 999 (excluding 1 and 1000), sums them, and displays the result. The number of iterations can be determined by the user or set to a predefined limit.

**Input**: None (random numbers are generated)  
**Output**: The total sum of the random integers generated

### 3. Multiply Two Integers Without Using `*`
This program multiplies two integers without using the multiplication operator (`*`). It simulates multiplication by adding the first number repeatedly, based on the value of the second number. It handles both positive and negative numbers.

**Input**: Two integers  
**Output**: The product of the two integers
